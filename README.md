A basic implementation of the CYK algorithm. This code can be used to understand the algorithm or as a start point to develop a more complex parser.

# Usage

`python3 src/test.py <grammar_file> <sentence>`

Example: 
 
`python3 src/test.py data/grammar.cfg "I prefer the morning flight through Denver"`
